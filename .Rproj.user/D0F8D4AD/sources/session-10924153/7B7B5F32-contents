	abstract = {Urbanization causes hydrological change and increases stormwater runoff volume, leading to flooding, erosion, siltation and the degradation of natural drainage system. Best management practices ({BMPs}) as an alternative approach to better natural flow regime by using decentralized designs to control stormwater runoff at the source, rather than at a centralized location in the watershed. {BMP} such as permeable pavement can be retrofitted in residential street, infiltration trench can be retrofitted in roadside stormwater drain, rain barrel storage can be retrofitted in building roofs and bioretention cell can be retrofitted in park. The present paper describes a modelling approach to incorporate four types of {BMPs} in the study site and estimates the impacts of {BMPs} on flood volume and peak flow reduction. Results depict that use of these four {BMPs} leads to significant stormwater control for reducing the risk of flooding in the study site.},

	title = {Assessment of long-term changes in lakes and natural drainage patterns of Bengaluru city using historical satellite images},
	abstract = {Bengaluru City once known for its beautiful lakes has lost its glory due to indiscriminate urbanization and many lakes have been gradually converted to different land use and rest of the surviving lakes are reduced to cesspools due to direct discharge of industrial effluents, sewage, dumping of solid wastes. Hence, it is very much essential to conserve, manage and maintain lakes as a part of the urban ecosystem and restore to its pristine status. The present study jointly undertaken by Regional Remote Sensing Centre – South, {NRSC}/{ISRO} and Karnataka Lake Conservation and Development Authority (now Karnataka Tank Conservation and Development Authority) for creating systematic geospatial database for analysing the spatio-temporal dynamics of lakes and drainage patterns. Major focus of the study was to characterize the entire catchment area of the city using satellite and collateral data for prioritization of watersheds / lakes to identify the hot spots and generate inputs for developmental plans for conservation, preservation and rejuvenation of lakes and to prevent further deterioration. Considering the rapid expansion of Bengaluru city, the present study has been carried out at two levels a) Core urban area – in {BDA} limits consisting of 1301 sq. km and b) Extended study area – in combined catchment area of Arkavathi and South Pinakini rivers covering 4000 sq.km. The work components included preparation of satellite database, delineation of watershed \& morphometric analysis, inventory of drainage \& lakes, mapping of surface water spread area and customization of Lake Information System. The watershed boundaries were delineated hierarchically from basin to micro-watershed level along with codification. The present study mainly focused on systematic generation of geodatabase for physical characterization of lakes and drainages. Corona Space Imagery of 1965 was used as reference data, while, {LISS}-{IV} and Cartosat-1 data of 2017 was used for change analysis. All-weather capable Synthetic Aperture Radar ({SAR}) data from Sentinel-1 satellite was used for mapping of surface water spread area of lakes. Ancillary data like Digital Elevation Model, {SOI} topographical maps (1972), cadastral maps (1903-1926) and detailed field survey data were used in interpretation for improving the quality of database. Ground truth was collected for 120 selected lakes using Mobile app to augment satellite data analysis. Digital image processing, {GIS} and data analytic techniques were used for integration of different thematic and ancillary data for analysing the spatio-temporal dynamics of lakes and drainage patterns. The extensive database created under the project helps to work out detailed conservation and revival plans for selected lakes \& drainages (streams) towards bringing back live lake system of Bengaluru.},

The secondary data were used, which are Landsat images for years 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2020. The Supervised Maximum Likelihood classification, the Markovian transition estimate, and the {CA}-Markov chain analysis were employed with {ArcGIS} 10.6.1, {IDRISI} 17.0, and {MS}-Excel 2013. The result revealed that the existing and simulated maps for the years 2000, 2010, and 2020 showed an almost equal probability of changes. The simulation for 2030 is credible for the future prediction, which showed that a significant estimate occurs. Therefore, the {CA}-Markov model is appropriate for land use/land cover predictions.},

The main goal of {BCI} is to replace or restore useful function to people disabled by neuromuscular disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, cerebral palsy, stroke, or spinal cord injury. From initial demonstrations of electroencephalography-based spelling and single-neuron-based device control, researchers have gone on to use electroencephalographic, intracortical, electrocorticographic, and other brain signals for increasingly complex control of cursors, robotic arms, prostheses, wheelchairs, and other devices. Brain-computer interfaces may also prove useful for rehabilitation after stroke and for other disorders. In the future, they might augment the performance of surgeons or other medical professionals. Brain-computer interface technology is the focus of a rapidly growing research and development enterprise that is greatly exciting scientists, engineers, clinicians, and the public in general. Its future achievements will depend on advances in 3 crucial areas. Brain-computer interfaces need signal-acquisition hardware that is convenient, portable, safe, and able to function in all environments. Brain-computer interface systems need to be validated in long-term studies of real-world use by people with severe disabilities, and effective and viable models for their widespread dissemination must be implemented. Finally, the day-to-day and moment-to-moment reliability of {BCI} performance must be improved so that it approaches the reliability of natural muscle-based function.},

	abstract = {Objective: Hyperactivity, one of the core symptoms of {ADHD}, has been mostly neglected in neuropsychological assessment of childhood {ADHD}. The neuropsychological Quantified behavior Test ({QbTest}) separately assesses all three core symptoms of {ADHD} on a behavioral level. Factor structure of the {QbTest} and its concurrent and discriminant validity are presented. Method: An exploratory factor analysis (n = 828 children) was performed. In a second sample (n = 102 children) a Multi-Trait-Multi-Method ({MTMM}) approach was used for validity analyses. Results: A three factorial model explained 76 \% of the total variance, with the resulting {QbTest} factors significantly influenced by age and gender. The {MTMM} approach yielded promising results for discriminant, yet inconsistent findings for concurrent validity between the {QbTest} and another attention test as well as for Conners' Parent and Teacher Rating Scales. Conclusion: Results indicate that the {QbTest} may be helpful for the behavioral assessment of childhood {ADHD}, yet further studies on its psychometric quality and clinical utility are needed.

To what extent are patients’ self-reported problems reflected in {QbTest} performance? Does Qb testing foretell the future, as reflected in the patients’ and clinicians’ judgements 4 years later? We here recorded the three {QbTest}+ cardinals–{QbActivity}, {QbImpulsivity} and {QbInattention} – in 67 consecutive {ADHD} patients diagnosed in adulthood. Among the 54 patients who medicated as usual on the day of testing, 35 (65\%) scored above the clinical cut-off (Q-score ≥ 1.25) on at least one of the {QbTest}+ cardinals. Out of the 13 patients who suspended medication prior to the test, 11 (85\%) scored above the clinical cut-off on at least one of the Qb-variables. There were modest associations between {QbTest}+ cardinals and symptom self-ratings [Brown {ADD} scale ({BADDS}); Adult Self-Report Scale ({ASRS})]. Forty-one patients completed a second {QbTest}+ approximately 4 years after the first. Performance was improved on the follow-up test and fewer patients scored in the clinical range (34\%). The scores on the {QbInattention} cardinal at baseline correlated positively with {BADDS} and {ASRS} self-ratings at the 4-year follow-up.},

Confirmatory and exploratory factor analyses were conducted with an outpatient sample of 773 subjects ≥12 years old. In a second sample of 297 patients ≥16 years, a multitrait–multimethod analysis was performed to examine concurrent and discriminant validity. The discriminative power of the Qb+ was investigated using a general linear model and logistic regression analysis. The three factorial structure (Hyperactivity, Inattention, Impulsivity) was verified in the confirmatory factor analysis. Fit indices demonstrated a good model fit and factor loadings were almost all moderate to high. In the multitrait–multimethod analysis, the criterion for convergent validity was fulfilled. The discriminant validity of the Qb+ was partially supported. Significant but small gender and age effects were found. In the logistic regression analysis, omission errors and reaction time variability, belonging to the Inattention factor, were able to discriminate between subjects with and without attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. The internal structure of the Qb+ was verified. Its validity was partially supported. Results regarding discriminative power were mixed.},

This evaluation focuses on {QbTest} in the clinical assessment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ({ADHD}), with emphasis on studies designed to evaluate the performance of {QbTest} as a decision support tool, that is, the intended use, and studies designed to evaluate discriminatory ability as a diagnostic test. A literature search of publications was made until May 2023. For the first part, studies investigating {QbTest} as a decision support tool were included. For the second part, studies designed to evaluate {QbTest} as a stand-alone test were included if sufficient information for a weighted average calculation of discriminatory power was included in the publication. Eleven studies on participants with {ADHD} were included for which {QbTest} was used in the diagnostic procedures of the disorder. One prospective randomized controlled study designed to evaluate {QbTest} when used for its intended purpose demonstrated a reduced time to diagnosis and increased diagnostic confidence. Ten studies designed to evaluate {QbTest} as a diagnostic test were identified. {QbTest} performed well with a weighted average sensitivity of 0.89 and specificity of 0.87 across studies with normative controls. In the challenging group of population with differential diagnosis (participants referred to a secondary or tertiary clinical care level), {QbTest} performed with a weighted average of 0.79 and 0.71 for both sensitivity and specificity. When including only studies of robust sample size (each study arm ≥50), the weighted averages were 0.83 and 0.86 for specificity and sensitivity, respectively. The addition of a {QbTest} reduced the time to a diagnostic decision without compromising diagnostic accuracy in a randomized control trial. When {QbTest} was evaluated for discriminative ability, an overall satisfactory weighted average sensitivity and specificity was found. The intended use of {QbTest} is to be used as a support tool rather than a standalone test in the clinical assessment of {ADHD}.},

Biofeedback has been shown to help with anxiety, depression, headaches, chronic pain, incontinence, and high blood pressure. 
Basically, biofeedback is a simple way to improve your mind-body connection and learn to regulate your nervous system. In this video you’re going to learn all about biofeedback, and by the end of this video, you’ll know how to do it on your own, without any equipment. 
Biofeedback is literally feedback about what your biology is doing. About 90\% of the things going on with your body right now are subconscious: your breathing, heart rate, digestion, blood pressure - your autonomic nervous system is just running those without you thinking about it.  
With biofeedback you can actually measure what is going on with your autonomic nervous system and learn to calm it down. This can be super helpful with anxiety and other physical conditions.

In therapy I use a combination of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, Systems Theory, positive psychology, and a bio-psycho-social approach to treating mental illness and other challenges we all face in life. The ideas from my videos are frequently adapted from multiple sources. Many of them come from Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, especially the work of Steven Hayes, Jason Luoma, and Russ Harris. The sections on stress and the mind-body connection derive from the work of Stephen Porges (the Polyvagal theory), Peter Levine (Somatic Experiencing) Francine Shapiro ({EMDR}), and Bessel Van Der Kolk. I also rely heavily on the work of the Arbinger institute for my overall understanding of our ability to choose our life's direction. 
And deeper than all of that, the Gospel of Jesus Christ orients my personal worldview and sense of security, peace, hope, and love https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/c...

	abstract = {Neurofeedback is a kind of biofeedback, which teaches self-control of brain functions to subjects by measuring brain waves and providing a feedback signal. Neurofeedback usually provides the audio and or video feedback. Positive or negative feedback is produced for desirable or undesirable brain activities, respectively. In this review, we provided clinical and technical information about the following issues: (1) Various neurofeedback treatment protocols i.e. alpha, beta, alpha/theta, delta, gamma, and theta; (2) Different {EEG} electrode placements i.e. standard recording channels in the frontal, temporal, central, and occipital lobes; (3) Electrode montages (unipolar, bipolar); (4) Types of neurofeedback i.e. frequency, power, slow cortical potential, functional magnetic resonance imaging, and so on; (5) Clinical applications of neurofeedback i.e. treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, depression, epilepsy, insomnia, drug addiction, schizophrenia, learning disabilities, dyslexia and dyscalculia, autistic spectrum disorders and so on as well as other applications such as pain management, and the improvement of musical and athletic performance; and (6) Neurofeedback softwares. To date, many studies have been conducted on the neurofeedback therapy and its effectiveness on the treatment of many diseases. Neurofeedback, like other treatments, has its own pros and cons. Although it is a non-invasive procedure, its validity has been questioned in terms of conclusive scientific evidence. For example, it is expensive, time-consuming and its benefits are not long-lasting. Also, it might take months to show the desired improvements. Nevertheless, neurofeedback is known as a complementary and alternative treatment of many brain dysfunctions. However, current research does not support conclusive results about its efficacy.},

It is used as a complementary treatment for a variety of neuropsychological disorders and improvement of cognitive capabilities, creativity or relaxation in healthy subjects. In this review, various types of {EEG}-{NFB} training are described, including training of slow cortical potentials ({SCPs}) and frequency and coherence training, with their main results and potential limitations. Furthermore, some general concerns about {EEG}-{NFB} methodology are presented, which still need to be addressed by the {NFB} community. Due to the heterogeneity of research designs in {EEG}-{NFB} protocols, clear conclusions on the effectiveness of this method are difficult to draw.

	url = {https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2018.00100},
	abstract = {Neurofeedback ({NFB}) is a real-time paradigm, where subjects learn to volitionally modulate their own brain activity recorded with electroencephalographic ({EEG}), magnetoencephalographic ({MEG}) or other functional brain imaging techniques and presented to them via one of sensory modalities: visual, auditory or tactile. {NFB} has been proposed as an approach to treat neurological conditions and augment brain functions. Although the early {NFB} studies date back nearly six decades ago, there is still much debate regarding the efficiency of this approach and the ways it should be implemented. Partly, the existing controversy is due to suboptimal conditions under which the {NFB} training is undertaken. Therefore, new experimental tools attempting to provide optimal or close to optimal training conditions are needed to further exploration of {NFB} paradigms and comparison of their effects across subjects and training days. To this end, we have developed open-source {NFBLab}, a versatile, Python-based software for conducting {NFB} experiments with completely reproducible paradigms and low-latency feedback presentation. Complex experimental protocols can be configured using the {GUI} and saved in {NFBLab}'s internal {XML}-based language that describes signal processing tracts, experimental blocks and sequences including randomization of experimental blocks. {NFBLab} implements interactive modules that enable individualized {EEG}/{MEG} signal processing tracts specification using spatial and temporal filters for feature selection and artifacts removal. {NFBLab} supports direct interfacing to {MNE}-Python software to facilitate source-space {NFB} based on individual head models and properly tailored individual inverse solvers. In addition to the standard algorithms for extraction of brain rhythms dynamics from {EEG} and {MEG} data, {NFBLab} implements several novel in-house signal processing algorithms that afford significant reduction in latency of feedback presentation and may potentially improve training effects. The software also supports several standard {BCI} paradigms. To interface with external data acquisition devices {NFBLab} employs Lab Streaming Layer protocol supported by the majority of {EEG} vendors. {MEG} devices are interfaced through the Fieldtrip buffer.},

Jane believes expert silos and scientific elitism have left the public prey to misinformation - placing lives in danger - and powerless to contribute to changing our future. She explains how the Open Science movement has driven inclusive global online collaboration to combat threats like {COVID} 19 and climate change. She urges people without scientific training -from Uber drivers to hairdressers - to follow their passions, believe in their insight, re-envision scientific discovery, and help sculpt the Artificial Intelligence of the future. 

6:50 - Seattle has become a global hub for involving all people in scientific research through game play and online challenges.
9:41 - Learn about {NASA}’s Globe Program where people from around the world work with {NASA}’s scientists to combat global warming...and how to poop on the moon.

Dr. Jane Roskams says: “yes!” As a neuroscientist who is at the forefront of national and global efforts to democratize science, Dr. Roskams is aiming to improve the way scientific discoveries can happen—and she believes the key missing ingredient is you.

Through two key movements, “Citizen Science” and “Open Science,” Dr. Roskams shares how scientists can increase the rate of international data sharing and unlock faster scientific breakthroughs. She also emphasizes how everyday people can use their passions and untapped talent to team up to drive this scientific revolution – and maybe help us learn a thing or two about improving our mental health.

Dr. Roskams is one of the first scientists to lead an international, federally funded and citizen crowd-sourced neuroscience project that is all online. She is a dynamic leader at the forefront of the “Open Data” movement. Dr. Roskams—who is also a professor at University of British Columbia and the University of Washington—spends much of her time building bridges and alliances across sectors so that we can all help to transform our understanding of climate change, human health and the universe beyond and within our brains- and be empowered to change all of our futures.

Learning to recognize, modify, and regulate brain states is critical to all children's development and can improve learning, and emotional and mental health outcomes. How can we design usable and effective {NF} {BCIs} that help children learn and practice brain state self-regulation? Our contribution is a list of challenges for this emerging design space and a conceptual framework that addresses those challenges. The framework is composed of five interrelated strong concepts that we adapted from other design spaces. We derived the concepts reflectively, theoretically, and empirically through a design research process in which we created and evaluated a {NF} {BCI}, called
              Mind-Full
              , designed to help children living in Nepal who had suffered from complex trauma learn to self-regulate anxiety and attention. We add rigor to our derivation methodology by horizontally and vertically grounding our concepts, that is, relating them to similar concepts in the literature and instantiations in other artifacts. We illustrate the generative power of the concepts and the inter-relationships between them through the description of two new {NF} {BCIs} we created using the framework for urban and indigenous children with anxiety and attentional challenges. We then show the versatility of our framework by describing how it inspired and informed the conceptual design of three {NF} {BCIs} for different types of self-regulation: selective attention and working memory, pain management, and depression. Last, we discuss the contestability, defensibility, and substantiveness of our conceptual framework in order to ensure rigor in our research design process. Our contribution is a rigorously derived design framework that opens up this new and emerging design space of {NF} {BCI}'s for children for other researchers and designers.},
