    "text": "BCI stands for Brain Computer interfaces. BCIs are devices that let the human brain communicate with and control external software or hardware. It is a communication pathway between the brain’s electrical activity and an external device, in this case a computer.\nBCIs are primarily of three kinds - invasive, partially invasive, non-invasive.\n\n\n\nImage source: https://www.paradromics.com/blog/enabling-connection-ii-bci-for-assistive-communication\n\n\n\nInvasive BCIs\nA brain computer interface is said to be invasive if it involves surgery to implant micro electrodes under the scalp. They are implanted directly into the grey matter of the brain and produce the highest quality signals.\nThe earliest examples of invasive BCIs have been in the field of artificial vision and motor neuroprosthetics. Direct brain implants have been used to treat acquired blindness. One of the first scientists to produce a working brain interface to restore sight was private researcher William Dobelle (Kotler, n.d.) Researchers at Emroy University in Atlanta were the first to install a brain implant strong enough to simulate movement (Kennedy and Bakay 1998)\n\n\nPartially invasive BCI\nThese are brain computer interfaces that are implanted into the skull but rest outside the brain and not inside the grey matter. The most popular example of partially invasive BCI is ECoG.\nECoG stands for Electrocorticography. ECoG measures electrical activity of the brain from beneath the skull. The earliest trials for ECoG were done in the Washington University in St. Louis, one of the experiments enables a participant to play the game Space Invaders using his ECoG implant (Lutz 2006)\n\n\nNon Invasive BCI\nThese are brain computer interfaces that do not require surgery or implants of any kind. They are predominantly EEG (Electroencephalography) devices. These interfaces are easier to wear. However they have poor spacial resolution and the skull dampens some signals. Additionally EEG devices require time and effort to get useful signals and readable electrical activity prior every session.\n\n\n\n\nKennedy, P. R., and R. a. E.

Neurofeedback is a non-invasive method that assists subjects to control their brain waves consciously. It is often done through simple games and activities. Electroencephalography (EEG) signals are recorded during neurofeedback and its various components based on frequencies are extracted and visualized to create a feedback loop.\nThere exist various neurofeedback treatment protocols i.e. alpha, beta, alpha/theta, delta, gamma, and theta, the protocol is decided based on the patient’s specific case requirements. Different EEG electrode placements also exist i.e. standard recording channels in the frontal, temporal, central, and occipital lobes.\nThere are multiple implications of NFB therapy i.e. treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, depression, epilepsy, insomnia, drug addiction, schizophrenia, learning disabilities, dyslexia and dyscalculia, autistic spectrum disorders and so on as well as other applications such as pain management, and the improvement of musical and athletic performance.

    "text": "Eyes open vs Eyes closed states\nSince we are recording brain waves from the visual cortex. You can clearly visualize the difference between eyes open and eyes closed states.\nEyes open has lesser brain activity and the waves have a smaller amplitude\n\nEyes closed has more brain activity especially between 8 to 20 hz range. This indicate the production of Alpha waves and beta waves. Alpha waves are produced when the brain is relaxed, and beta waves when the brain is focused.",
