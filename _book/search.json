This website is curated as a supporting repository to a conceptual kiosk proposed to be set up in NIMHANS Museum or other public spaces.\nThe main objective is to compile useful information and resources around the theme of Brain computer interfaces to foster curiosity, experimentation and speculation.\nIf you are someone who engages with BCI and non-invasive EEG devices of any kind, your contribution to this website would be much appreciated. The github repository can be found here.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "BCI stands for Brain Computer interfaces. BCIs are devices that let the human brain communicate with and control external software or hardware. It is a communication pathway between the brain’s electrical activity and an external device, in this case a computer.\nBCIs are primarily of three kinds - invasive, partially invasive, non-invasive.\n\n\n\nImage source: https://www.paradromics.com/blog/enabling-connection-ii-bci-for-assistive-communication\n\n\n\nInvasive BCIs\nA brain computer interface is said to be invasive if it involves surgery to implant micro electrodes under the scalp. They are implanted directly into the grey matter of the brain and produce the highest quality signals.\nThe earliest examples of invasive BCIs have been in the field of artificial vision and motor neuroprosthetics. Direct brain implants have been used to treat acquired blindness. One of the first scientists to produce a working brain interface to restore sight was private researcher William Dobelle (Kotler, n.d.) Researchers at Emroy University in Atlanta were the first to install a brain implant strong enough to simulate movement (Kennedy and Bakay 1998)\n\n\nPartially invasive BCI\nThese are brain computer interfaces that are implanted into the skull but rest outside the brain and not inside the grey matter. The most popular example of partially invasive BCI is ECoG.\nECoG stands for Electrocorticography. ECoG measures electrical activity of the brain from beneath the skull. The earliest trials for ECoG were done in the Washington University in St. Louis, one of the experiments enables a participant to play the game Space Invaders using his ECoG implant (Lutz 2006)\n\n\nNon Invasive BCI\nThese are brain computer interfaces that do not require surgery or implants of any kind. They are predominantly EEG (Electroencephalography) devices. These interfaces are easier to wear. However they have poor spacial resolution and the skull dampens some signals. Additionally EEG devices require time and effort to get useful signals and readable electrical activity prior every session.\n\n\n\n\nKennedy, P. R., and R. a. E.

Depending on the number of electrodes available and the EEG band primarily being recorded, the placement on the scalp is decided.\n\nEach electrode placement site has a letter to identify area of the brain it is reading from: pre-frontal (Fp), frontal (F), temporal (T), parietal (P), occipital (O), and central (C).\n“Z” electrodes are often utilized as ‘grounds’ or ‘references’. FpZ, Fz, Cz, Oz are zero sites and present mostly for reference/measurement points.\nEven-numbered electrodes (2,4,6,8) refer to electrode placement on the right side of the head, whereas odd numbers (1,3,5,7) refer to those on the left",
