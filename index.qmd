# Context {.unnumbered}

The project aims to democratize access and understanding of BCI (Brain-Computer Interfaces), particularly non-invasive EEG devices. This website is curated as a supporting repository to a conceptual kiosk proposed to be set up in NIMHANS Museum or other public spaces.

The main objective is to compile useful information and resources around the theme of Brain computer interfaces to foster curiosity, experimentation and speculation.

If you are someone who engages with BCI and non-invasive EEG devices of any kind, your contribution to this website would be much appreciated. The github repository can be found here.
