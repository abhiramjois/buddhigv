# Non Invasive EEG

Non invasive EEG refers to brain computer interfaces that use electrodes that are placed on the scalp to record the electrical activity of the brain. They use a method called EEG which stands for Electroencephalography.

Voltage fluctuations measured by a bioamplifier and electrodes allow the evaluation of normal brain activity. As the electrical activity monitored by EEG originates in neurons in the underlying brain tissue, the recordings made by the electrodes on the surface of the scalp vary in accordance with their orientation and distance to the source of the activity.

A healthy EEG ranges between the frequency of 1 and 30 Hz, and amplitudes will vary between 20 and 100 μV.

## EEG Bands

Based on the frequency of the electrical activity, EEG is divided into subgroups. The different types of brain waves are

-   Delta (less than 4 Hz): Delta waves are observed in the EEG signal when a person is asleep

-   Theta (4–8 Hz): Theta waves are observed when a person is sleepy or drowsy

-   Alpha (8–13 Hz): Alpha waves are observed when a person is relaxed where the muscles are loose but they are awake.

-   Beta (13–30 Hz): Beta waves are prominent when a person is alert, busy, active or similar states

-   Gamma (30–100 Hz): Gamma waves are observed when a person is trying to solve a problem

## International 10-20 System

The 10-20 system is a globally accepted method to describe and apply scalp electrodes on a person's head while recording EEG. Depending on the number of electrodes available and the EEG band primarily being recorded, the placement on the scalp is decided.

-   Each electrode placement site has a letter to identify area of the brain it is reading from: pre-frontal (Fp), frontal (F), temporal (T), parietal (P), occipital (O), and central (C).

-   "Z" electrodes are often utilized as 'grounds' or 'references'. FpZ, Fz, Cz, Oz are zero sites and present mostly for reference/measurement points.

-   Even-numbered electrodes (2,4,6,8) refer to electrode placement on the right side of the head, whereas odd numbers (1,3,5,7) refer to those on the left
